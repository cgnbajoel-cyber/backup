STA won't recover when Iuno is in mid-air.\n- Iuno's movement becomes Meandering, which consumes STA continuously in mid-air to move in a unique manner.\n- Performing environmental interactions, using Utilities, or holding Jump will end Lunar Cycle.\n\n**Lunar Cycle - Half Moon**\n\nIuno attacks using the Moonring, restoring Sentience on hit.\n\nShe can use Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonbow to deal Aero DMG (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG) and switch to Lunar Cycle - New Moon.\n\nHeavy Attack - Flux: Moonbow can be cast in mid-air.\n\n**Lunar Cycle - New Moon**\n\nIuno attacks using the Moonbow. While in this state, casting Moonbow - Basic Attack, Resonance Skill - Arc Beyond the Edge, or Moonbow - Dodge Counter consumes Sentience to increase the skill's DMG Multiplier, restore additional Concerto Energy, and heal nearby Resonators in the team.\n\nIuno can use Heavy Attack - Flux: Moonring to deal Aero DMG (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG) and switch to Lunar Cycle - Half Moon.\n\nHeavy Attack - Flux: Moonring can be cast in mid-air.\n\n**Heavy Attack - Absolute Fullness**\n\nWhen Iuno's Concerto Energy is full, her Heavy Attack is replaced with Absolute Fullness.\n\nCasting Absolute Fullness ends Lunar Cycle, provides healing for nearby Resonators in the team, deals Aero DMG to nearby targets (considered as Resonance Liberation DMG), and conjures a Full Moon domain at her location. This effect can be triggered once every **25s**.\n\nCan be cast in mid-air.\n\n**Full Moon Domain**\n\nResonators inside the domain periodically restore HP and STA.\n\nGaining a Shield inside the domain grants **1 **stack of Blessing of the Wan Light. This effect can be triggered once every **0.5s**.\n\n**Blessing of the Wan Light**\n\nThe receiving Resonator gains **4%** all DMG Amplification for **10s**, stacking up to **10 **times.
