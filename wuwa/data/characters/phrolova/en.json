Hecate will share Phrolova's stats and statuses, and damage dealt by Hecate will be considered coming from Phrolova. Hecate's attacks will not remove the target's Hazy Dream state.\n\nDuring this period, Phrolova plays the Volatile Notes in turn. Each Volatile Note holds for **4s**.\n\nIf Phrolova is the active Resonator on the field, she can give the following cues to Hecate. Any damage taken by Hecate in this state affects Phrolova as well.\n\n- **Cue - Basic Attack**: Press Normal Attack to command Hecate to cast Basic Attack - Hecate. When Phrolova is the active Resonator on the field, for every **2** times Hecate casts Basic Attack - Hecate, the next Basic Attack - Hecate is replaced with Enhanced Attack - Hecate.\n- **Cue - Dodge**: Press Dodge to command Hecate to dodge an attack. Hecate takes no damage from a hit successfully Dodged.\n- **Cue - Reset**: Press Jump to reset Hecate's position.\n- Cu**e - Curtain Call**: Press Resonance Liberation to command Hecate to cast Curtain Call and end the Maestro state.\n\nWhen Phrolova is not the active Resonator, Hecate takes no damage and automatically casts Basic Attack - Hecate to attack the target. When Resonators in the team cast Echo Skill, Hecate casts Enhanced Attack - Hecate to attack the target. This effect can be triggered up to **10 **times in total during Phrolova's Maestro state.
